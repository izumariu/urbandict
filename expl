Yeet is a beautiful and commnly misused word. It is very flexible and can take many parts of speech. However, it&apos;s tenses are often used incorrectly. In the future, you &quot;will yeet,&quot; In the present you &quot;are yeeting,&quot; and in the past, &quot;you yote.&quot; &quot;Yote&quot; is often replaced with &quot;yeeted,&quot; but that is a prime example of poor grammar. Using &quot;yeeted&quot; instead of &quot;yote&quot; would be like saying &quot;eated&quot; instead of &quot;ate.&quot; It makes you sound like a baby or a moron. &quot;Yeet&quot; as a verb 1. to make a violent motion of any variety, such as a &quot;whip,&quot; or any motion that may be associated with violent camera shake or photo blur. 2. &quot;Yeet&quot; is quite commonly used as a verb for the specific purpose of throwing an object forcefully over a long distance. 3. &quot;Yeet&quot; can also be used as something you&apos;d include in a sentence to describe what happened to someone who has been greatly or suddenly defeated in a competition such as sports or a video game. &quot;Yeet&quot; as a pro-sentence 1. In this case, &quot;yeet&quot; takes the role of &quot;yes.&quot; You&apos;d say &quot;yeet&quot; instead of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;yeah&quot; if you want people to know you&apos;re fun and hip. &quot;Yeet&quot; as an exclamation 1. This form of &quot;yeet&quot; can be exclaimed in any situation where the verb form could be used to describe the action in which the speaker is currently partaking. For instance, if you throw something violently or hit a nasty whip, you may exclaim &quot;Yeet!&quot; while doing so.
